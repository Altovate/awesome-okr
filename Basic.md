# OKR
Objective - Key Results (**OKR**) are used to tell the direction of a business and how to get there.

From the mission & vision, you can derive your Objectives and the Todos are the things you do to achieve your Key Results.

## Rules
1. Set them annually and quartely
  - A quarter and a year are timeframes in which you really can achieve something. The same timeframes are also used to evaluate companies
2. Don't have too many
  - 5 Objectives with 4 Key Results each is your maximum per quarter
  - Having more will only distract you from what really needs to be done.
3. Make them challenging.
  - Research demonstrates that people who set challenging targets achieve more.
  - Expect to get to 70-80% of your challenging target.
4. A KR must have a number.
  - Number enable objective evaluation and create a learning process
  
# Grading
- Only Key Results get graded. An Objective's grade is the average of its Key Results. 
- A good Key Result always enables objetive grading.
- Objetive grading is necessary for **learning**
- Grading shall **never** be used for employee evaluation

### Guidelines for Grading
- Use a scale from 0 to 1.
   - Getting to 70-80% of your target will result in a .7 or .8 grade
   - Grade your OKRs at the beginning of the next quarter
   - If you constantly score a 1, your OKRs were not challenging enough. 
   - You should score a .7 or .8


## Examples
1. You sell barbeques online. 
   - You want to grow revenue to 1 million this quarter (**objective**)
      - Rank Top 3 in Google's Search Results for 'buy barbeque'
      - Run a 20%- discount-campaign in 2 national newspaper


## Summary
- Objective: Tell you where to go
- Key Results: Tell you how to get there
